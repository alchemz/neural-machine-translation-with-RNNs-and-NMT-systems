# Analyzing NMT
Note: Heavily inspired by the https://github.com/pcyin/pytorch_basic_nmt repository

If you would like to instead create a new environment for this assignment, please run:

# 1. Create an environment with dependencies specified in local_env.yml (note that this can take some time depending on your laptop):
    
    conda env create -f local_env.yml

# 2. Activate the new environment:
    
    conda activate cs224n_local_nmt
    

# To deactivate an active environment, use
    
    conda deactivate
